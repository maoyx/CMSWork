 1. Download latest POWHEG package

svn checkout --username anonymous --password anonymous svn://powhegbox.mib.infn.it/trunk/POWHEG-BOX

2. Install LHAPDF or use the one installed in lxplus external 

2a. install LHAPDF

download it from https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/install.html

!!! Usually you will have to download the PDFSets before your built by following the suggestion 

after installation, don't forget to add lhapdf library into your environment (the ones in the setup.sh)

export LHAPDFSYS=/home/maoy/working/GeneratorStudy/CMSSW_5_3_20/src/POWHEG/lhapdf
export PATH=${PATH}:${LHAPDFSYS}/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${LHAPDFSYS}/lib
export LHAPATH=/home/maoy/working/GeneratorStudy/CMSSW_5_3_20/src/POWHEG/lhapdf/share/LHAPDF

3. Compile POWHEG for a given process, e.g. Dijet production

cd POWHEG-BOX/Dijet

4. change the Makefile to include the right library and PATH for lhapdf, fortran, et al

make pwhg_main

5.  Run POWHEG to produce the LHE file

cd testrun-lhc 

 modify powheg.input and set the parameters you interested

../pwhg_main

To run batch jobs with many lhe files generation, you can see the script powheg.slurm for SLURM job submission, and bash script to make large productions with different seed runpowheg.sh

6. Setting up and running Rivet in CMSSW

6a. Get the RivetInterface:
git cms-addpkg GeneratorInterface/RivetInterface 

6b. Get the generator config file you want to use, e.g from within the CMSSW working area src/ subdirectory
wget -P Configuration/GenProduction/python/SevenTeV/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cms-sw/genproductions/master/python/SevenTeV/Hadronizer_TuneZ2_7TeV_generic_LHE_pythia_cff.py

6c. Get the Rivet config:
wget -P Configuration/GenProduction/python/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cms-sw/genproductions/master/python/rivet_customize.py 

6d. Compile:
scram b

6e. Create the config-file with cmsDriver (on one line)
cmsDriver.py Configuration/GenProduction/python/SevenTeV/Hadronizer_TuneZ2_7TeV_generic_LHE_pythia_cff.py -s GEN --filein pwgevents.lhe

You can chose how many events to generate and what analyses to run by editing the file you created (rivet_cfg.py). By default, the output file is out.yoda and the default analyses are set in Configuration/GenProduction/python/rivet_customize.py. You can adjust both of these by adding the two lines below to rivet_cfg.py.

        process.rivetAnalyzer.AnalysisNames = cms.vstring('CMS_2015_HIN14001R5')
        process.rivetAnalyzer.CrossSection = cms.double(ivars.sigma)
        process.rivetAnalyzer.OutputFile = cms.string(ivars.output)

6f. Run generator and analyse the output rivet using cmsRun:
cmsRun rivet_cfg.py

6g. To make plots of your analysis, you can use the command 
rivet-mkhtml filename.aida

6h.To convet the aida file into root format
aida2root file.aida

To run batch jobs with many lhe files, you can see the script rivet.slurm for SLURM job submission, and bash script to loop over all the lhe files rivetana.sh
